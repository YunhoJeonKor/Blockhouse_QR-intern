This is Yunho Jeon (yj3258@nyu.edu), currently studying Mathematics in Finance at NYU.

I have constructed the required Order Flow Imbalance (OFI) features based on the given dataset.
All computations are performed with a time interval of 10 seconds, and the resulting features are provided in the file ofi_features_output.csv.

 Constructed Features

1. Best-Level OFI
	â€¢	This feature captures the order flow imbalance at the best bid and ask levels (level 0).
	â€¢	It is computed at each 10-second timestamp and is saved under the column best_level_ofi.

2. Multi-Level OFI
	â€¢	This feature accounts for OFI values across deeper levels of the order book.
	â€¢	For levels 0 through 9, the columns deep_ofi_0 to deep_ofi_9 are created, each representing OFI at that specific level.

3. Integrated OFI
	â€¢	Following the methodology described in the paper, this feature aggregates the multi-level OFIs into a single measure.
	â€¢	It is provided under the column integrated_ofi and reflects a more comprehensive imbalance by integrating depth information.

ðŸ’¬ Remarks

The original paper also discusses cross-asset OFI as an extension. However, the dataset I was given only includes order book data for Apple stock.
Therefore, implementing cross-asset OFI was not feasible in this case. Despite that, I closely followed the feature construction methodology as outlined in the paper to ensure consistency and validity.

Moreover, as shown in the paper through the included screenshot, the next step is to calculate OFI-based beta values and test their predictive power using techniques such as Lasso regression and other regularization methods.
This lays the groundwork for further empirical analysis and robust model building.
